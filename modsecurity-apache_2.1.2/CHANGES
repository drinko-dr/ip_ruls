27 July 2007 - 2.1.2
--------------------

 * Cleaned up and clarified some documentation.

 * Update included core rules to latest version (1.4.3).

 * Enhanced ability to alert/audit failed requests.

 * Do not trigger "pause" action for internal requests.

 * Fixed issue with requests that use internal requests.  These had the
   potential to be intercepted incorrectly when other Apache httpd modules
   that used internal requests were used with mod_security.

 * Added Solaris and Cygwin to the list of platforms not supporting the hidden
   visibility attribute.

 * Fixed decoding full-width unicode in t:urlDecodeUni.

 * Lessen some overhead of debugging messages and calculations.

 * Do not try to intercept a request after a failed rule.  This fixes the
   issue associated with an "Internal Error: Asked to intercept request
   but was_intercepted is zero" error message.

 * Added SecAuditLog2 directive to allow redundent concurrent audit log
   index files.  This will allow sending audit data to two consoles, etc.

 * Small performance improvement in memory management for rule execution.


11 Apr 2007 - 2.1.1
-------------------

 * Add the PCRE_DOLLAR_ENDONLY option when compiling regular expression
   for the @rx operator and variables.
 
 * Really set PCRE_DOTALL option when compiling the regular expression
   for the @rx operator as the docs state.
 
 * Fixed potential memory corruption when expanding macros.

 * Fixed error when a collection was retrieved from storage in the same second
   as creation by setting the rate to zero.

 * Fixed ASCIIZ (NUL) parsing for application/x-www-form-urlencoded forms.

 * Fixed the faulty REQUEST_FILENAME variable, which used to change
   the internal Apache structures by mistake.

 * Updates to quiet some compiler warnings.

 * Fixed some casting issues for compiling on NetWare (patch from Guenter Knauf).


23 Feb 2007 - 2.1.0
-------------------

 * Removed the "Connection reset by peer" message, which has nothing
   to do with us. Actually the message was downgraded from ERROR to
   NOTICE so it will still appear in the debug log.

 * Removed the (harmless) message mentioning LAST_UPDATE_TIME missing.

 * It was not possible to remove a rule placed in phase 4 using
   SecRuleRemoveById or SecRuleRemoveByMsg. Fixed.

 * Fixed a problem with incorrectly setting requestBodyProcessor using
   the ctl action.

 * Bundled Core Rules 2.1-1.3.2b4.

 * Updates to the reference manual.

 * Reversed the return values of @validateDTD and @validateSchema, to
   make them consistent with other operators.

 * Added a few helpful debug messages in the XML validation area.

 * Updates to the reference manual.

 * Fixed the validateByteRange operator.

 * Default value for the status action is now 403 (as it was supposed to
   be but it was effectively 500).

 * Rule exceptions (removing using an ID range or an regular expression)
   is now applied to the current context too. (Previously it only worked
   on rules that are inherited from the parent context.)

 * Fix of a bug with expired variables.

 * Fixed regular expression variable selectors for many collections.

 * Performance improvements - up to two times for real-life work loads!

 * Memory consumption improvements (not measured but significant).

 * The allow action did not work in phases 3 and 4. Fixed.

 * Unlocked collections GLOBAL and RESOURCE.

 * Added support for variable expansion in the msg action.

 * New feature: It is now possible to make relative changes to the
   audit log parts with the ctl action. For example: "ctl:auditLogParts=+E".

 * New feature: "tag" action. To be used for event categorisation.

 * XML parser was not reporting errors that occured at the end
   of XML payload.

 * Files were not extracted from request if SecUploadKeepFiles was
   Off. Fixed.

 * Regular expressions that are too long are truncated to 256
   characters before used in error messages. (In order to keep
   the error messages in the log at a reasonable size.)

 * Fixed the sha1 transformation function.

 * Fixed the skip action.

 * Fixed REQUEST_PROTOCOL, REMOTE_USER, and AUTH_TYPE.

 * SecRuleEngine did not work in child configuration contexts
   (e.g. <Location>).

 * Fixed base64Decode and base64Encode.


15 Nov 2006 - 2.0.4
-------------------

 * Fixed the "deprecatevar" action.
 
 * Decreasing variable values did not work.

 * Made "nolog" do what it is supposed to do - cause a rule match to
   not be logged. Also "nolog" now implies "noauditlog" but it's
   possible to follow "nolog" with "auditlog" and have the match
   not logged to the error log but logged to the auditlog. (Not
   something that strikes me as useful but it's possible.)

 * Relative paths given to SecDataDir will now be treated as relative
   to the Apache server root.

 * Added checks to make sure only correct actions are specified in
   SecDefaultAction (some actions are required, some don't make any
   sense) and in rules that are not chain starters (same). This should
   make the unhelpful "Internal Error: Failed to add rule to the ruleset"
   message go away.

 * Fixed the problem when "SecRuleInheritance Off" is used in a context
   with no rules defined.

 * Fixed a problem of lost input (request body) data on some redirections,
   for example when mod_rewrite is used.


26 Oct 2006 - 2.0.3
-------------------

 * Fixed a memory leak (all platforms) and a concurrency control
   problem that could cause a crash (multithreaded platforms only).

 * Fixed a SecAuditLogRelevantStatus problem, which would not work
   properly unless the regular expression contained a subexpression.


19 Oct 2006 - 2.0.2
-------------------

 * Fixed incorrect permissions on the global mutex, which prevented
   the mutex from working properly.

 * Fixed incorrect actionset merging where the status was copied from
   the child actionset even though it was not defined.

 * Fixed missing metadata information (in the logs) for warnings.


16 Oct 2006 - 2.0.1
-------------------

 * Rules that used operator negation did not work. Fixed.

 * Fixed bug that prevented invalid regular expressions from being reported.


16 Oct 2006 - 2.0.0
-------------------

 * First stable 2.x release.
